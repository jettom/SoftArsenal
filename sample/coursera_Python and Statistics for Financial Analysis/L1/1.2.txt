The very first step of financial data analysis is to get data. One of the popular format for storing data is CSV file. In this video, you will learn how to import files with CSV format and how to save data into DataFrame structure. We have to import pandas in the notebook before we use any functions or data structure from pandas. To import pandas, you can type, import pandas in Jupyter Notebook like this. It is more convenient to use a short name. Hence, alternatively, you can type import pandas as pd. Then you just need pd to represent pandas. For example, if you want to use any modules or functions from pandas, you can type pd FunctionName or pd ModuleName. Now, we want to import two data files, facebook.csv and microsoft.csv. These are historical stock data of Facebook and Microsoft. We can import these two files with two lines of codes like that. We are using DataFrame to store data, therefore we need a pd. The method from_csv help us to read the CSV files saved in the form of data. We assign names fb and ms to these two DataFrames. We can use a method type to check the data structure of fb. As we can see, this is a DataFrame from pandas. By looking at this output, the historical data of Facebook has been successfully imported as a DataFrame. In the next video, we will explore the details of methods and attributes of DataFrame.
