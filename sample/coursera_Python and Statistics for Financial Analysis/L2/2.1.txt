In this video, we will discuss what is a random variable, the outcome and different types of random variable. Let us start with a very simple game, we roll two dice. In this game, we will compute and record the sum of face values of two dice. Using Python, we can mimic this game. Variable die has six values, one to six, with equal chance which stands for the real die. We use the pandas method sample to mimic the game. In a programming code, two means we are rolling two dice. Then we can calculate the sum for face values of these two dice and we get eight. If we roll two dice 50 times, we can get 50 observation or realize outcomes of sum. Here, we print out first 10 observation of 50 trials. You may notice that it is possible to have same outcomes since we role dice independently in each trial. In this game, the sum, which we denote as X, is a random variable. Before we roll a die, we are not sure which outcome we can get. That is called Randomness of variable. But we know the collection of outcomes, which ranged from 2 to 12. The collection of outcomes on the left is not a random variable. Instead, they are realized or observed outcomes of values of X. Outcome is basically the results of the game. In the example above, the possible outcomes include integers from 2 to 12. So, it is called Discrete random variable. There is another type of variable, for example, daily return of a stock price. It can take any real values. Hence, it is called continuous random variable. We will discuss these two types of variables in more details in the next video.
