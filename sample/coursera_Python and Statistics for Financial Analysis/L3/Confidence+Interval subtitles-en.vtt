00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.915
In this video,

2
00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:13.645
we will explore how to estimate the average return using confidence interval.

3
00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:19.065
Here is a sample of the log return of a stock price of Apple.

4
00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:22.760
We can get average return in this sample.

5
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.120
We can sample mean to estimate the real average return,

6
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.415
which is population mean in our example.

7
00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:35.345
We want to do more about estimation.

8
00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:41.175
Intuitionally, if a sample is a good representative of the population,

9
00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:44.465
the population mean should be close to sample mean.

10
00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:51.975
It is plausible to say that the population mean is in a range with sample mean centered.

11
00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:57.409
Hence, our task in this video is to estimate

12
00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.140
population mean using interval with lower and upper bound.

13
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.510
To start with, we need to standardize sample mean

14
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.675
because different sample has different mean and a standard deviation.

15
00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:17.995
We have learned that distribution of sample mean is normal in our last video.

16
00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:22.695
We can standardize sample mean by minus it's mean,

17
00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:28.575
which is identical to population mean and then divided by its standard deviation,

18
00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:34.765
which is the standard deviation of population divided by square root of sample size.

19
00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:39.470
After standardization, it'll become standard normal,

20
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.305
and follows Z-distribution.

21
00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:47.375
For Z-distribution, it is not difficult to find the two quantities;

22
00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.390
Z Alpha over two,

23
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.860
and Z, one minus Alpha over two such that in the middle,

24
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.035
the probability is one minus Alpha.

25
00:01:58.035 --> 00:02:02.625
Since Z is symmetric with respect to zero,

26
00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:09.550
the magnitudes of these two quantiles are the same except the sign.

27
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:18.740
We have Z_1 minus Alpha over two equal to negative Z Alpha over two.

28
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.245
Since the standardization form of sample mean is also Z,

29
00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:28.805
then we have this equation.

30
00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:32.585
With some calculation in the parenthesis,

31
00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:35.090
we can have this form,

32
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.155
which explicitly gives the upper and lower bounds for population mean.

33
00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:46.040
Notice that Sigma is the population standard deviation,

34
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.620
which is usually unknown.

35
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.010
In practice, we can replace it using

36
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.045
the sample standard deviation if sample size is large enough.

37
00:02:57.045 --> 00:03:05.130
The interval here, for Mu is called confidence interval at the level of one minus Alpha.

38
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.030
In our problems, to build the interval for the average return,

39
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.330
we need to find quantiles of mean distribution which has been discussed in topic two.

40
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.875
We can use the norm.ppf to get the quantiles.

41
00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:26.735
Here, alpha over two is equal to 0.1,

42
00:03:26.735 --> 00:03:31.330
hence confidence level is 80 percent.

43
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.870
Then we can calculate sample mean and the standard deviation of

44
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.685
sample in which the population standard deviation

45
00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:44.615
is replaced by sample standard deviation.

46
00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:48.685
The 80 percent of confidence interval is printed out.

47
00:03:48.685 --> 00:03:56.400
Average return of Apple stocks falls in this interval with 80 percent chance.

48
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.835
Notice, this interval is on the positive side.

49
00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:06.905
It implies that the average return is very likely to be positive.

50
00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:13.640
In next video, we will discuss another statistical inference tool,

51
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.850
hypothesis testing, which can be applied to detect difference or change of population.
