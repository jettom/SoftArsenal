hello everyone welcome to another lecture of school of Solana today we'll
0:06
be talking about the introduction into the rust programming language before we begin uh let's talk a little
0:12
bit about the content of this lecture so yeah we'll be talking about the introduction to rust uh we'll not be
0:19
talking about Solana Concepts today yet that's for uh lecture for next week and
0:24
we'll be doing some of the Hands-On examples to get our hands dirty and introduce ourselves into how rust
0:30
programming works so yeah before we do any coding uh let's
0:35
just briefly talk about rust history uh how kind of rust came out to be one of
0:41
the most favorite programming languages currently in the software development ecosystem
0:47
so yeah rust is a modern systems programming language it prioritized safety speed and concurrency it is
0:54
statically and strongly typed programming language and it was founded as a personal project of great and
1:00
Horror in 2006. uh in 2009 it was sponsored by Mozilla foundation and
1:06
later a quote unquote acquired by Mozilla and it is maintained by Mozilla to this day it supports basm uh or
1:15
webassembly it has a lot of popularity and systems programming game engine
1:20
development and obviously into the blockchain ecosystem starting with Solana and a lot of the new L1 uh a lot
1:29
of the new layer one blockchains kind of popping up right now like appdos or sui
1:35
that also support trust as their main Pro or not main or but as their main or
1:41
as their programming language for developing programs there
1:46
so yeah the very first release of rust came to be in 2015 and it saw a rapid
1:53
growth uh in uh in the point that it established Its Own Foundation in 2021
1:58
which is only six years after the first release and it became a most loved
2:05
language since 2016's 2016 and rust popular popularity only
2:11
grows year by year there are many companies using rust right now and a lot of the popular
2:17
applications are written by rust but for us obviously it's Solana but you can
2:23
find difference like cloudflare or one password that are those where
2:28
fundamentals are already built on Rust programming language
2:34
so yeah that's up for the introduction and let's just let's Jump Right In and
2:39
talk about the basics of it all and that's obviously a hello world program so as you can already tell uh hello
2:47
world hello world program in Rust is very similar to hello world in pretty
2:52
much any other language so we are essentially defining our main function using an FM keyword and in that
3:00
function we are printing out the line with Hello World string so you can just go right ahead and uh
3:07
copy it into your development environment however if you have not yet set up your development environment you
3:14
can use something called rust playground I will just demo a rust playground
3:20
playground for now so essentially you can just copy different rust Snippets
3:25
and execute them directly in your browser so we have our hello world demo
3:30
already in the playground and we can just run it and see the output directly into the browser
3:37
so yeah uh so if you have not yet set up your development environment go ahead
3:43
and use rust playground but you can just go ahead and use uh whatever tools you
3:48
need to execute the Snippets that we'll be demonstrating today
3:55
in this slide we can see that we can Define variables in Rust using a lead keyword
4:01
keep in mind that rust is statically type language and that means that
4:06
compiler needs to know what type are the variables at the compile time but however in this slide we can see
4:13
that we are not explicitly defining what types of that what types are those different variables
4:19
uh this is because rust has something that is called inference engine and it's
4:25
pretty smart it does more than just looking at the type of the value expression during the
4:31
initialization but it also looks how the variable is used afterwards in the
4:36
program so that means that we can essentially Define variables without specifying the
4:42
data type let my sim really familiar to a lot of
4:47
you JavaScript developers but it's definitely not the same thing in Rust in JavaScript and many other languages
4:54
variables created with lead are mutable by default that means we can initialize
4:59
it with some value and then essentially change or re-initialize that value to a different one
5:05
uh this is however not the case in in Rust so if we take for example uh this
5:12
piece of code where I'm defining a variable called name and I'm assigning or initializing with the value Andre and
5:19
at the uh at the next line we're trying to change that value of that particular
5:25
variable this would be completely fine in JavaScript however if I try to run it in
5:31
in Rust we will end up with an error
5:36
that says we cannot assign twice to immutable variable name
5:42
this means that in Rust all variables created using let keyword are immutable
5:49
by default that means you cannot reassign their value once they already been assigned
5:55
however if I create if I create a variable and I will not assign it that
6:02
means I will assign it in into the in the next line this will still be fine in Rust we are
6:09
not mutating it we are just assigning or initializing with the value
6:15
foreign
6:21
if we get to the previous example and we want to create or make our variable
6:28
mutable we'll be doing that by adding a mut keyword which is short formutable
6:34
and if we uh add keyword mutable to to our variable
6:39
name we are then free to reassign the value so if I run it again
6:45
this will compile just fine
6:54
so if we take a look at the at this next slide we can see that we can obviously
7:01
manually specify the data types of the variable when defying it all of the standard variables types that
7:08
we know from other programming languages are available at our disposal so that means we can use assign and unsigned
7:14
integer uh floating Point types booleans characters and strings but we'll be
7:21
talking specifically about strings a little bit later so let's talk about strings in Rust
7:29
strengthen rust aren't as simple as strings in JavaScript for example in JavaScript both arrays and strings where
7:37
strings are pretty much just an array of characters are mutable and ever growing so all of us are kind of used to keep on
7:46
pushing to a string or array in JavaScript mutating its length and it works just fine
7:52
this is this is because strings in JavaScript uh JavaScript are Heap allocated and they don't have a fixed
7:58
line the this is however a little bit different in Rust so if we take this
8:03
example where we are creating a mutable list with a length of free and then we try to
8:11
reassign it to a list with a different length essentially trying to mutate the List's length this will fail
8:23
this is because arrays and rust are stack allocated and with fixed length
8:28
this doesn't mean that you can't have a collection in Rust which you can grow and Shrink with time as much as you want
8:35
it's that just it's a completely different data type that we are calling vector
8:41
so this also tells us that there will be a two different underlying types of
8:46
strings in Rust there are two so Str which is essentially a string slice
8:52
similar to an array it is fixed length and it is immutable on the other hand we have a string a
9:00
string is stored as a vector and it is used to store utf-8 data with not a
9:05
fixed lens so if we for example take our first example and we are using a
9:13
data type called SDR we can uh initialize it with some uh with some
9:20
value however we'll be unable to mutate its limb uh at the at the later stage in
9:27
the program so we are essentially tied down to this value
9:33
so this is typically what we don't want we want to have a little bit more fun with strings uh kind of resizing the
9:40
data structure and do whatever we are used to with doing with strings in different programming languages and this
9:47
is where string or data data type called string come to a help
9:53
so here you can see an example where I'm creating a mutable variable called name and we are creating a string from some
10:00
sort of uh from some sort of uh characters which in this case is ond and
10:06
then we can for example manipulate it as we are used to in different programming languages so I'm here I'm pushing here
10:13
I'm pushing more characters into the predefined string so if I run this one
10:26
okay it will work completely fine and you can see that R2 substrings are combined now
10:32
into one string so yeah our first example with the Str
10:40
data type they are uh always we are there are essentially string slides and
10:47
they are similar to array in Rust they are fixed length and unmutable the second one is a string object this
10:55
one is stored in a vector and it is used to store the utf-8 data with not a fixed
11:00
length and a little bit more freedom to work with with working with it as much as we are kind of used to from different
11:07
programming languages so let's sum up what we have learned
11:12
about data types and variables in Rust so even though rust is statically typed
11:19
language and that means compiler needs to know what types are the variables at the compile time we can create variables
11:27
without specifying its type and let the inference engine do its work
11:32
if we want to specify the type we can do it uh with the specification right after we
11:40
name our variable however in terms of naming our variable there are few rules we have to follow
11:48
letters digits and underscore characters are available for us to name our variables variables have to begin with
11:57
either a letter or an underscore and this is really important upper and
12:03
lowercase letters are distinct in terms of naming our variable and the key thing is that by default
12:10
variables are immutable which means if we want to reassign or change the value
12:16
of our variable we have to make our variable mutable by adding an mut
12:23
keyword so let's talk a bit about functions in
12:29
Rust functions in Rust are defined using an FN keyword
12:35
and with curly brackets so pretty much the structure is very similar to other programming languages we Define using an
12:42
FN keyword naming our function and then selecting the input parameters that our
12:47
function should have so in terms of we have already kind of defined our first function before in our
12:55
hello world program where we created a main function in every program which is
13:00
the main entry point but in this particular example we can see that our main function is calling a different
13:06
function called FN hello and FN hello then prints out a hello from function f
13:12
and hello so this is a like a really basic example how we can call different functions in Rust
13:19
if we want to talk about return types we have two different syntaxes that we can
13:25
use the first syntax is obviously specifying the return type with an arrow
13:30
and then returning it using a return keyword however there is some nice syntactic
13:37
sugar in Rust where we don't even have to use a return keyword to return our
13:42
value uh you you could we can totally skip the return keyword and the result of the
13:48
last expression in the function body will be returned automatically or essentially uh the the last resort
13:57
with no semicolon means that the value is automatically returned
14:02
so let's take a look at our sample here we have our main function where we are
14:08
calling our sum function which is essentially just summing the two X and Y
14:13
numbers that are in our uh that are in our function parameters and are returning a returning an unsigned 64-bit
14:21
integer so yeah if we try to execute it
14:27
you can see that we have our result value so we are essentially defining a new variable called result which will
14:34
take the return value of our sum function we can
14:40
see here that we are not even using our return keyword we're just essentially
14:46
doing x a plus Y without no semicolon this will automatically return our value
14:53
and then we are printing out the result from our variable
14:59
so let's briefly introduce a flow control and Loops in Rust
15:04
so just like any other programming language rust 2 has conditionals so both
15:09
if if else or else statements are pretty much identical to how they work in
15:15
JavaScript with two subtle differences if statements in Rust don't need
15:21
expression to be wrapped into parentheses and rust will not cast Expressions to
15:28
booleans for you like JavaScript does but if we look at a really simple sample
15:34
here let's just do this simple if condition where we are checking the value of our
15:42
variable so for example here we can see our if statement combined with some
15:48
logic operators those are obviously also available to us in Rust so you can see
15:53
that the structure of our L of our if statement is pretty much similar to the one in JavaScript and this one is
16:00
completely valid and will execute just fine so you can see that in terms of
16:06
conditionals you can carry a lot of the knowledge from a different programming language like JavaScript or pretty much
16:11
any any other programming language if we're talking about loops uh rust
16:18
obviously have loops too uh there are a few types of them and let's just introduce them briefly one by one
16:26
so uh the most basic one is essentially defining a loop using a keyword Loop so
16:34
if we do something like this we essentially create a Loop that is
16:42
equal to while true in JavaScript it is essentially uh just a simple Loop that
16:47
will be running into Infinity until some condition is met and uh we will manually
16:53
break our Loop using the break keyword so this is again something very similar
16:59
to other programming languages if we are if we want to use a different
17:04
type of loop we can for example use a while loop in Rust something that we are
17:10
well familiar with from different uh programming environment so if we do
17:15
something like a wild Loop where we are essentially adding a condition to our
17:20
Loop so the while loop uh is running until this condition is met so in this
17:26
particular case until the counter is less or equal to 10 our Loop will execute so if we run it we'll
17:32
essentially get Hello uh 10 times so yeah that's uh that's pretty much a
17:39
while loop and other really cool loop that we can use in in Rust is for in Loop for in
17:47
Loop will essentially let us Loop through um for example different elements in
17:54
Array so in this example we can see that we are looping through our La of sdrs so
18:00
my name is Andre and it will run through all of these elements and print them out line by line
18:13
so as you can see in terms of flow control and Loops you can carry a lot of the knowledge that you already have
18:19
there is uh a bit of a synthetic difference but essentially uh the basis
18:27
of flow control and Loops are pretty much the same in Rust if we want to shorten for example our if
18:34
statements we can do it by creating an inline if statement so this one is totally fine in Rust too so we can
18:42
create a condition variable and then uh we can essentially wrap our if statement
18:47
into a variable so let's Define a variable called number that will be assigned uh
18:56
that or or the value of this number variable will be assigned uh according
19:02
to this if statement so if the condition is true the value of our number will be
19:07
6 else the value will be the value will be 5 else the value will be 6. so yeah
19:13
that is totally fine in Rust two so let's talk briefly about memory
19:18
management in Rust uh when you write your code in JavaScript you never worry
19:24
about allocating and deallocating memory actually most of the JavaScript developers don't even know how to manage
19:30
memory properly memories automatically allocated under the hood when it's required by the
19:36
runtime environment and the JavaScript runtime engine usually is using
19:42
something that we call garbage collection so I believe that most of you are already familiar with the garbage
19:48
collection but essentially garbage collection is a hidden code in your runtime that is constantly keeping track
19:54
of the values in your program and checking if there are any references to them
19:59
uh when it sees that something is no longer referred to and it is marked as unnecessary it decides to deallocate it
20:07
and freed from the memory you can immediately tell that having something like this running during
20:13
runtime constantly comes at the performance cost but not only is a performance cost also as a security
20:19
concern because garbage collectors can sometimes screw up and it will result result in memory leaks
20:27
so Ross does not have a garbage collector and you are probably panicking
20:32
right now because you're familiar that c or C plus plus require programmer to
20:38
manually allocate and deallocate memory and if you're not skilled enough it can
20:43
be a really big security concern and it is really hard to master a proper memory
20:48
management so that's where borrow Checker comes in even though that the rust is not using a
20:55
garbage collector when you're riding in Rust you don't need to manually allocate or deallocate the memory it's already
21:02
taking care of you by the compiler the rust compiler automatically inserts
21:07
allocation and deallocation calls in the right places in your code and it can do
21:12
it because you have to follow strict rules about how you write your rust code and if you don't it will just not
21:18
compile so it may be hard at first but when you get the hang of it out of the nowhere
21:24
you're riding high performance and secure programs so let's learn about borrow checking and
21:29
ownership to kind of understand how memory management in Rust works
21:36
so now let's talk about bar Checker and this is what enables rust to automatically insert memory allocation
21:43
and deallocation in our code when it is compiled so to do this the bar Checker requires
21:50
us to follow this the simple concept of ownership it might be hard to understand at first but when you get the hang of it
21:58
it is pretty easy and it will help you write a secure and high performing code so we have prepared this simple test how
22:06
we can demonstrate the ownership in in just a brief snippet
22:12
so for example we have a main function that where we're defining a test
22:17
variable it is essentially string from this characters which is a testing
22:22
and then we passing our variable into the owner one and owner one function
22:28
will print out our variable so if we run this everything should work out fine
22:36
so you can see that the owner one uh print out the string that we wanted
22:41
but what if we do this thing so uh we ask owner one to print out the string
22:47
and we will ask our owner to function to essentially to essentially do the same
22:54
thing
23:01
and this is where we run into some issues and why is that uh it is because
23:07
one simple rule that we have to follow in Rust and that is every value in Rust must have a single owner and to kind of
23:15
demand demonstrate the ownership when we initialize the variable test
23:20
the string value testing is owned by our test variable then on
23:27
the next line we are passing our variable to owner one function and by
23:33
doing that we move our variable to owner one and at this point this variable is
23:39
no longer owned by our main function and it is owned by owner one this is what we
23:44
call a transferring of the ownership so the value is only owned by one hour
23:52
owner and the owner is responsible for deallocating the memory and that's where
23:59
the uh and it it deallocates it when the owner goes out of the scope
24:04
so essentially the owner is the error is telling us that we no longer have access
24:11
to our variable because we already moved it to a different owner and it just
24:17
essentially stuck there and we cannot work with our variable anymore
24:22
so how can we solve this we have two different ways of solving
24:27
this and the first one is bypassing the immutable references so uh we can create immutable references
24:36
very easily and that is essentially just by adding an ampersand before our data
24:42
type which is not which is now saying it is a reference to a string variable
24:49
and if we are expecting a reference we obviously have to hand over a reference
24:55
not the variable so we'll be handing out the reference to our test variable
25:00
so by doing this it should essentially fix our problem in this uh particular
25:08
case so yeah as you can see right now the
25:14
owner one and owner to print out the print out the string so by passing uh
25:21
the references we are essentially bending the rule that I mentioned before that every value in Rust must have a
25:27
single owner we are kind of bending it into a into a fact that
25:34
um a value can have any number of immutable or mutable references to it so but
25:42
bypassing an immutable reference it automatically tells us that we cannot
25:47
change uh the the variable from the immutable reference so what if we want
25:53
to change the value of our reference we can do that by passing mutable
25:59
references so I have pre prepared a different snippet of code to kind of demonstrate this we
26:07
have a simple main function and this main function has a mutable variable called greetings that is kind
26:14
of constructing hi my name is uh from from these characters into a string then
26:20
we want to mutate it the mutation will happen in a different function that is called mutate the mutate will push
26:28
string Andre into the greetings so essentially in the end it should print out hi my name is Andre
26:35
so you can immediately tell that we are again using ampersands to mention that
26:43
we are passing a reference and adding an mut as a mutable reference
26:48
a big warning here that if we are passing a mutable reference we have to
26:53
uh or we have to it we have to create a mutable reference to immutable variable
27:00
in the first place because if the variable is immutable and cannot be changed immutable reference would be
27:07
just completely meaningless so if we try to run this code everything should work out just fine
27:18
yeah so uh you see that we have uh hi my name is Andre ducana expand a little bit
27:24
on this let's just add a second mutate function and push another string just
27:32
some exclamation marks and we can run both of these mutation
27:37
strings and we should be all good
27:46
and as you can see uh we have passed the mutable reference to two different functions without passing the ownership
27:53
we have added a string in both of these functions and at the end we still had
27:58
access to our greeting strings so this is just a simple demo how ownership or
28:05
how ownership which is the basis for borrow Checker Works in Rust
28:12
so what have we learned about the ownership rules and memory management in Rust
28:17
each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner every value in Rust have a single owner
28:26
and when the owner goes out of scope the value will be dropped and essentially marked as inactive and deleted from the
28:34
memory if we want to pass our values we can do it by using a references these
28:42
references can be immutable or mutable and the value can have any number of
28:47
references to it if we'll be passing an immutable reference please make sure
28:53
that we are passing a mutable reference to a mutable variable or a mutable value
29:00
so let's briefly touch on slices in the rust so
29:05
an array in Rust is a collection of objects of the same type and we are
29:11
defining and using the brackets we are specifying the data type and their length and the length of the array is
29:18
always known at the compile time slices on the other hand are similar to
29:25
a race but their length is not known at the compiled time instead a slice is
29:31
kind of a two-word object where the first word is a pointer to our array
29:37
that we are slicing and the second word is the length of the slice
29:43
a great example of a previous explanation is the Str type that we did
29:48
in the string section because we're calling Str a string slice as it is
29:54
exactly what it represents it's essentially a pointer to some memory that is including a valid udfa data
30:02
hence why string slice is not Global or mutable in any way because it is baked
30:08
in the binary itself so yeah and uh slices are obviously not
30:14
reserved for Strings only uh we will probably use them mostly on vectors or array
30:20
so to demonstrate this let's borrow an example from the rust documentation
30:26
so as we can see in the main function we are defining our array of numbers and we
30:33
can work with this array as we are kind of used to in JavaScript so for example we can print out values at the different
30:40
indexes so essentially just indexing Stars at the zero that's pretty
30:45
much classic and we can print out any of the values in the array for example we can also print out a
30:53
count of the elements or the array length so we can just do some of these
30:58
very familiar operations on the array in Rust 2. however uh
31:04
we can also borrow the array automatically as a slice and to do so
31:09
we just specify pointer to our array and then specify
31:16
the uh length of the slice that we want to do and we have these analyze slides
31:22
function to kind of perform all of the operations we're kind of used to on doing on the standard array we can also
31:30
do it on as a slice but we are obviously working only with the borrowed data so
31:36
if we run this example you can see that we did some of these
31:44
array operations on the whole array then we borrowed the array as a slice and did
31:50
the same operation only on the element that we borrowed using the slice
31:55
so let's briefly touch on how we can create structures in Rust there are three types of structures or
32:02
also shortly called structs that we can create using the struct keyword so as you can see the we are using
32:10
struct keyword to create a new structure we set the name of the structure and
32:15
using the curly brackets to set up the fields of the structure this is pretty similar to how we Define functions and
32:22
everything else in the rust so uh about the three different uh types
32:27
of structures uh there are Tuple structs which essentially are just name tuples or a pairs of two values a classic
32:36
c-structs that we are seeing on the screen right now so we are essentially gonna create uh different fields with
32:43
different data types for the structure and also uh unit structs which are
32:48
fieldless but are useful for generics so let's just demonstrate it real quick
32:59
so in this code we can see how we Define a unit structure as you can see they are
33:04
fieldless to construct Tuple struck is essentially a pair so here is a pair of integer at float and then we have a
33:11
struct or C like structure with Fields so in our main function we can see that we
33:18
are creating a new variable of of a point which is our structure and we are
33:24
setting up the chord in its X and Y to different values after we instantiate the point we can
33:30
def we can just easily work with its Fields so here we can see it demonstrated in the print line we are
33:36
printing out the coordinates X and Y from our point that we have previously created
33:44
foreign
33:50
so as you can see you are essentially creating structs very similarly to any other programming languages that do uh
33:57
enable us to create structures so next just briefly touch on
34:03
enumerators or enums uh enorms are essentially we are defining them using
34:10
an enum keyword and this allows us a creation of a type which may have one of
34:15
few different variants so this is a essentially demonstrations of Direction and we can see that uh
34:22
our different variants are up down left and right it's also worth pointing out that any
34:30
variant which is a valid as a struct is also valid as an enum
34:35
so this was just a brief introduction to enums and structs in Rust and as you can see if you know how to handle these from
34:41
any different programming languages they easily carry to rust also thank you for
34:47
attending today's lecture and now I will hand it over to my colleague to give you
34:52
details about our next assignment hello everyone so now that you have
34:58
learned how to use rust and the basics of rusts we have prepared our next task
35:04
for you you will have to finish an implementation of a calculator so it is
35:10
a simple calculator written in Rust again the repository will be on GitHub
35:17
classroom so we will share the link after this lesson on on Discord and you will also learn
35:24
something new you will learn about trades so it's basically an equivalent of interfaces in other languages
35:32
but don't worry you will have enough information in in readme
35:39
and to pass this task you have to pass the tests or your implementation and
35:46
basically you can test it very easily with the cargo test command that will
35:52
automatically run the tests so if you will pass the tests then you
35:59
should be all right and as always if you will have any questions don't hesitate to ask on
36:06
Discord so thank you very much for today I hope you enjoyed uh today's lecture and have
36:14
fun with the task and see you next time goodbye
